# Introduction



# METHODS

## Dataset creation

In order to create the dataset, we use a slightly modified version of the Antibody Antigen Dataset Maker (AADaM) [1] available under https://github.com/samuelfromm/AADaM-fork.
As a starting point, we use all structures deposited in SAbDab on **2024-10-23 11:47:11**. The run our version of the Antibody Antigen Dataset Maker using the following parameters:

```
--inputDb=<All structures from SAbdAB downloaded --2024-10-23 11:47:11-->
--date=2021/09/30 #  training cutoff for AF 2.3 (see https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold/blob/main/docs/technical_note_v2.3.0.md)
--abCompSeqCut=80
--withinDatasetCut=80
--resCut=3.5
--cutoffStrict=True
--nx=True
--globalSeqID=True
--minAtomSeqresFraction=0.9
--methodsAllowed='X-RAY DIFFRACTION,ELECTRON MICROSCOPY'
```

For details on what the respective parameters exactly mean see the description for https://github.com/samuelfromm/AADaM-fork. 

The resulting dataset consists of 115 antibody-antigen structures. Each complex consists of one or several antigen chains, a heavy chain and a light chain (if applicable).

## MSA generation

The MSAs were generated using the standard We run Alphafold 2.3.2 pipeline (specifically commit `f251de6`). Out of the 115 complexes, one complex did not run due to a failure of HHblits.

# MODEL GENERATION

## AF2 based 

For the AF2 based methods, we use Alphafold 2.3.2 (specifically commit `f251de6`) unless stated otherwise.


*default*: We run 40 predictions per model with the AlphaFold 2 standard parameters, resulting in 40x5=200 models.

 # ISSUES

- For 1 ID, 8w90, the MSA generation did not run due to a failure of HHblits
- For 4 IDs, AADaM does not run properly (i.e. 8r4q,8ezl,8cz8,7tzh: the issue is that the L chain identifier output by AADaM is the same as the H chain identifier. One could probably fix these manually by looking up the correct L chain identifier in the ground truth PDB file but I decided to ignore this and move on.)
